## BG React App Port

Previous initial work on a (fullstack) Node/React port project of a pure JS/jQuery existing app. 
The most significant challenges were dealing with a big and confusing codebase poorly documented, filled with bad practices and anti-patterns spreaded out throughout the old codebase. The lack of frameworks and/or libraries besides jQuery contributed
to the difficulties of porting this app to current stacks and best practices as navigating through the legacy codebase was challenging in itself. Despite such downsides I left the project on a very advanced point, easy to be maintained, decently documented and on the path to be finished.

### Requirements

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-edition)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) or NPM

### Project structure:

`/src/index.js` Entry point for the app

`/src/App.js` App "Main Page" where all other pages (containers) are imported and routes handled.

`/src/{containerName}/` We are organizing files by "topics" therefore all files related to
a topic will be stored in the same container folder

`/src/{containerName}/index` CCntainer component and all React code such as the view (JSX)

`/src/{containerName}/reducer` Where we manage the piece of state related to the container

`/src/{containerName}/actions` All actions the container dispatches

`/src/{containerName}/sagas` Where sagas that watch for API related calls are stored

`/src/{containerName}/actionTypes` Constants for reducers/actions


`/src/services`
Abstraction facades for external API (where Parse JS-SDK layer resides).

`/src/index-reducer` & `/src/index-sagas` Where all reducers and sagas are included then exported.

`/mongodb` All MongoDB related files.

`/parse` All Parse Server files.
